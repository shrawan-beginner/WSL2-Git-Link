# Flex Exercises of the Foundations CSS Path

Flex is a powerful layout design property which allows the elements to be structured either horizontally or vertically on the document.
This helps for creating a complex layout easily using many of the properties that are present under **Flex** like _flex-direction_ (which lets you structure the elements either in row or column format), _flex-wrap_ (which allows the element to break into two lines if the spacing is small).

### The main exercises on the Foundations path are:

1.**flex-center**: (./exercise-1-flex-center)  
2.**flex-header**: (./exercise-1-flex-header)
