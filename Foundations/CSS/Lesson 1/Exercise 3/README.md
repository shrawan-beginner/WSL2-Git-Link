# Exercise 3 - Grouping Selectors of Foundations CSS path

This exercise further helps in practicing the grouping of CSS selectors on the html tags so common stylings will be stored in one single selectors, and only unique styles will have separate selectors.

I have used **btn** class selector as the common styles between the button elements, and **btn--primary** and **btn--secondary** as the unique classes to add individual styling for each of them.
