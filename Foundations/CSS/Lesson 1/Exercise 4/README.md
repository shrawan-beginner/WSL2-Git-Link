# Exercise 4 - Chaining Selectors of Foundations CSS path

This exercise shows how chaining different selectors and implementing CSS to them will reflect different stylings even if one of the selector is common.

Here a common selector `avatar` is combined with two different class selectors `proportioned` and `distorted` to show how different stylings can be applied based on the chaining of selectors.
