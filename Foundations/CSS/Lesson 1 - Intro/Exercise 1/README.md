Exercise 1

This exercise showcases the different methods available for declaring CSS styles on the HTML elements.

- External CSS: Used to declare CSS through a separate CSS file
- Internal CSS: Used to declare CSS through the use of `<style>` tag
- Inline CSS: Used to declare CSS in the element itself. This is rarely used, since it takes precedence over the other two methods which can cause some styling issues.
