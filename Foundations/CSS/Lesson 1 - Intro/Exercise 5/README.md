# Exercise 5 - Descendant Combinator of Foundations CSS path

This exercise shows how descendant combinator works in styling the elements that are inside one parent container.

Even if elements share the same class on multiple places/instances, but the CSS is only implemented on the elements that are directly under a parent selector, then the styling of those elements are changed, and other will remain as is.

Here, the styling is applied only on the elements that are under the parent `<div>` that has `container` class added to it.
