# Cascade Fix Exercise of Foundations CSS path

This exercise shows how cascade of the CSS stylings can have an impact on the overall stylings implemented on the HTML element.

If the styling is applied properly, but its not being reflected on the website, then it is most probably due to the specificity and order of the applied stylings.
So, once the order and specificity is properly fixed, the changes will reflect on the website without any issues.
